# uw-fsdl-bert-transfer-translation
Final Project for the UW Full Stack Deep Learning course: Build a translation model based on BERT to transfer previously learned tasks (e.g., translating from English to French) on a new language (e.g., translating from English to Spanish)

# TODOs

- Week 1: Collect and clean data from http://www.statmt.org/europarl/
- Week 2: Get the baseline model performance
  - Use vanilla BERT to train English-French model

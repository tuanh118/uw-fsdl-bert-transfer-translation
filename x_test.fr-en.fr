The Council wishes to point out that all EU Member States voted in favour of a provisional resolution on the issue, which the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe adopted on 6 October 1999, and which stated that the terms of payment proposed by the Turkish government could not be considered to be in compliance with the obligations in respect of the court decision taken, and forcefully urged Turkey to re-examine her position.

(PL) Mr President, in rising to speak in this debate, I wish to draw attention to the following problems: among the important causes of a low birth rate in Europe we have, firstly, difficulties in reconciling family life with working life, i.e. the inadequate number of places at nurseries for small children and the lack of socio-economic support for families and for women's employment.

   – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that Commission communication COM 2006 on the functioning of the transitional measures shows that the influx of workers from the EU-10 states into the states with open labour markets has not been at all great and, on the contrary, according to the experts, has had a positive effect by increasing output and improving the economy, and also in view of the fact that the transitional periods have clearly contributed to an increase in the numbers of illegal workers, I consider approval of the report by Mr Őry as a significant initiative which should help to open up labour markets fully in states throughout the European Union.
This is the issue we have spent more time and energy discussing over the last few months, if not years, than any other - and yet only 75% of its budget is actually being spent.

The debate on enlargement would become still more tense.
Unfortunately, the directive does not in any way ensure that this will be the case.
I feel it is important to highlight two points in this regard.

I should like to emphasise that it is now more necessary than ever to take action on this matter because, in addition to the problems by which it is already affected, Turkey is now faced with a severe political and economic crisis which will signify a setback for the democratic process and will mean that political prisoners in jails will be in an even worse position than they were before.

By this I mean an instrument which will permit repeated, interactive and fruitful contact between the cultures of the various Member countries in such a way that the variety of areas looked at and the multidisciplinary nature of the events become an ever more vitalising element in the very soil of European identity without threatening pluralism and the essential diversity of these cultures.
The third area that we were asked to prioritise is the fight against climate change.
However, there are still some loose ends, to which attention should be drawn: for example, the encouragement of technological research and development is not made totally subordinate to the need to protect the rights, independence and freedom of choice of persons.

Do elections need to be organised straight away?
Sadly, nothing has happened, which is something that I regret, because it is a waste of time to have mature debates and eloquent speeches on 8 March if we do not submit legislative proposals that will genuinely advance the policy and the equal treatment of men and women.
The changes it is hoped to introduce will not of course affect the Treaties.
If that does not happen then the Commission must act decisively.
These amendments relate to so-called 'business tourism' - conventions, congresses and business travel - which already accounts for nearly 20 % of European tourism and is highly likely not only to increase significantly in the medium term, but also to compensate for one of the most complicated phenomena in the tourist sector, namely seasonal variations.

We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value?
You see, Belgrade can be bombed, but not Moscow, Beijing or Ankara.
The fact that the regulation lists all the institutions - which means that discharge for the other institutions is just a matter of time - is an excellent result, as is the fact that it provides for a single auditor and accounting officer held in common by the two institutions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was probably not the only one to greet your statement about the German Presidency's objectives with mixed feelings.
(EL) Madam President, I am sorry but I can only assume two things: either that my supplementary question was not translated or that the President-in-Office of the Council did not reply at all to what I asked him.

It is our firm intention, shared with the Council, to put the neighbourhood instruments at the service of improving the situation in the field of human rights.
And I could cite many more examples of such an outcome.
Moreover, the rejection of two compromise amendments during the sitting bears witness to the difficulty of finding representative majorities, as does the rejection or acceptance, by the narrowest of margins, of institutional measures of the highest importance.
There is much about these plans and ambitions to which some of us might object, but one of the strengths of the European Union at its simplest is its role as a pole of attraction for countries that have not had the benefits of democracy, the rule of law and economic prosperity.
Lifelong learning is becoming more and more important in modern society.
We are awaiting the European Commission’s decision on the Common Frame of Reference.

In particular, I should like to congratulate Mrs Waddington on some of the innovative measures which she brings forward, but also on not being afraid to criticize where the Commission has fallen down on its duty and responsibility to respond to the urgent need for training in our society.
(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report on the grounds that the steps outlined in it need to be taken as a matter of absolute necessity if this European Union of ours is to be made a political union speaking with one voice to the outside world and hence capable of becoming a global player rather than a lame duck.
To be precise, we are on the right track: faced with a phenomenon such as asylum and immigration, a concern for many of us, cooperation, solidarity, clear legislation and realism are the necessary prerequisites for addressing one of the major challenges for the European Union in this new century.
I voted for paragraph 9, part 2, on the endowment of the globalisation and adjustment fund by businesses as this is a voluntary donation.

I believe that, on the Finnish initiative, the European Union is preparing to implement other initiatives on an international level, and I am grateful for that.
When US President Clinton visits South-East Asia at the end of March - James Elles referred to this - and if we are to visit India in April as the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament, then the subject of Kashmir will need to go to the top of the agenda.
Well, you could say that.
The discussion will undoubtedly be very profound, covering the overall concept of industrial policy, the overall concept of State aid and other issues as well.
Mr President, Mr Byrne, I disagree with you on one key point, namely that we cannot yet discuss the measures to be adopted once the current crisis has been brought under control.
We were also able to act as a catalyst in this area thanks to the conclusions of last month's European Council, which, and I quote, welcomed 'the Commission's intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries.'

Of course, we agree with the proposals in the Miller report on the extending the facilities enjoyed by Commission officials to the officials of the other institutions, including the European Parliament, which I believe will take a favourable view of the amendments we are presenting, which, in summary, recognise the good work done by the Commission.
I do, however, have a few comments to make.
If the report has nevertheless found majority acceptance, this is primarily thanks to the rapporteur's readiness to compromise, and I would like to express my personal appreciation of this.
I would also be delighted to support - as one of the original authors - the initiative on Sarajevo, as it is very important for us to show the people of this region that the EU is here for them.
Furthermore, they are not capable of being detonated by the foot of an innocent child, as is the case with antipersonnel mines.

Yet France’s record of applying EU law is one of the worst, its attitude to trans-frontier mergers is obstructionist, it has deliberately failed to meet its obligations under the stability and growth pact and it has consistently slowed down the pace of CAP reform.
If we do not dare to set those priorities, we do not show leadership.
If we want to be credible, we have to respond now and not only after tragic events, as has happened in the past.
Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras.
Next, of course, are the major European industrial lobbies which, despite their fine words, are absolutely opposed to any real development of environmentally efficient renewable energies, because Enel, E.ON and EdF are all too well aware that reducing our dependency on fossil fuels means making European consumers much freer of them as well.
This is contrary to the Treaties and also unnecessarily delays a large number of decisions.
A great writer once said that Balkan States always piled more historical responsibility onto their shoulders than they were capable of carrying.

We have also been able to develop the products from our land and the products from organic farming.
Is that not a matter for the Bureau or the responsible bodies?
The best economic recovery plan of all would be a radical redistribution of wealth and assets from top to bottom.
The CIA affair, the illegal kidnappings, the illegal overflights and the lack of cooperation by governments have been contributory factors, as have the negative judgments of the European Court of Justice on the transfer of passenger data and SWIFT bank data and the lack of legal bases for Union action.
Secondly: public health.
We have to make long-term plans for crisis regions, targeting and deploying as an integral whole our Community instruments – not only overseas aid, but also the prospect of closer relations with the EU.
The European Union and the Member States must be on the front line of this fight.

The selling off to big business of public corporations and their wealth, the abolition of all socialist achievements and ownership, the restriction on their sovereign rights and so forth are the price which the peoples of the candidate countries are paying and will continue to pay.
This is a measure that is of hardly any cost to the tyre industry, and therefore also to the consumer.
Mr President, some people think we should not get involved with this, because defence of the rights of homosexuals is an unjustified extension of human rights.
I will probably go there myself in order to signal the fact that the Commission is focusing on checking products from outside the European Union that are coming in through one of its major ports.
2.
That is only an initial discussion of the preliminary draft budget.
The discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and I believe that Parliament achieved concessions on the vitally important issues of financial guarantees, excavation sites, transitional provisions and acceding countries and on a number of other important points.
The European Union, as a community, must express support for all those who are fighting for women's rights in Afghanistan, so that we do not allow the destruction of all that has up to now been achieved in this area.
These 26 candles are a symbol that these detainees should not be forgotten and, indeed, I hope that these 26 and all 600 detainees will have access to justice.

We believe, on the contrary, that the most important work on combating these fires and their causes should be done locally and nationally and also be initiated and funded at those levels.
Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, which I believe.

If the vote on the discharge for the 1996 budget is now considered to be in the past and if the vote of censure of the Commission is currently making a mockery of this parliamentary session, then the motion for a resolution currently being examined doubtless belongs to the future.
There must be a new scheme to provide funds created in the European Union for cross-border cooperation, either in association with TACIS or as a separate arrangement.

A fair balance is needed which seeks to reconcile the legitimate interests and concerns of the nationals of the Member States with the needs of those who are seeking them.
The future is in a multifunctional agriculture which serves social, environmental and consumer needs.
They also have a responsibility to contribute to the goals of the urban mobility plans: sustainable, safe and reliable transport in urban areas.

Is it not now time to stop waiting for more encouraging noises from Turkey and demonstrate that the limit has been reached by revoking the customs union with this country?
Many amendments proposed by Parliament already conform to the text of the general orientation agreed in the ECOFIN meeting of 4 November 2008, or go in the same direction.
It is unfortunate that we were not able to obtain an answer before, but what is most unfortunate is that it was not sent through the usual channels according to the Rules of Procedure.
We hear talk about the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, but who has been talking about the 800 000 Assyrians that live in Iraq?
I trust the introduction of the new regulations will not cause him further distress and result in actual hair loss.
However, given that one of the sine qua non for taking over this operation is that permanent arrangements have to be in place between the European Union and ????, which there appears to be little likelihood of completing by the end of October, we may have to examine alternatives.
Mr President, more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in Venezuela.
(Applause)
But all of this could come to nought if the Commission does not allocate the funding needed to adopt the measures necessary to achieve an appropriate European policy on forests.

That is for specific resolution of a problem.
Setting up biogas plants is costly, however.
Adopt it, fight for it and, along with all the European institutions, fight for those farmers whom you already defend so fiercely.

How can it be justified?
We will protest if women are unfairly treated.
Effective implementation of the EU' s environment directives in the Member States is naturally of great significance in two ways: firstly, in terms of environmental protection - which is, of course, the whole purpose of the directives - but also in terms of our not causing confidence to be lost in EU legislative work through the Member States' being able for a long time to get away with not implementing the legislation which they themselves have helped bring about in the Council of Ministers.
Casting my mind back, however, I notice that we still have problems with the old bathing water directive.
But now the Cypriot Government has put forward a new proposal to establish a NATO peacekeeping force on the island and to bring about the withdrawal of the Turkish forces of occupation and the Greek armed forces from the island.
We must continue to raise these issues for the very reason that we do care about the Mexican people.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is common knowledge that, at regional level in the European Union, there is a close connection between low per capita income, high unemployment and distance from mainland Europe or geographical remoteness, which is currently a serious problem, but which has existed since the industrial revolution of the 19th century, due to underdeveloped communications.
What can the European Union do?
There is therefore an urgent need for action.
Thank you, Mr Ortuondo Larrea.
We must do everything to give a chance to the forces of moderation in both countries, to those who choose the difficult path of dialogue, rather than those who choose the easy path of violence.
The effects of the crisis of world capitalism and the consequences of its irregular and asymmetrical development are exacerbating the economic and social situation in many countries.
Public opinion is hostile or resigned.
With 27-28 or more States, the Union will need stronger institutions, not weaker ones. We will need a stronger, not weaker democratic commitment and a stronger, not more elusive legal system.
In the age of globalisation, human rights have a political and economic importance that goes over and above the humanitarian aspect, as demonstrated by the recent Asian crisis.
Taking all these factors into account, I decided to support the joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the recent earthquake in Haiti.
That is not serious, it is not ambitious, it is not global leadership.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only thank the rapporteur for her excellent work, which is very precise and detailed.
We will do it, I believe, without calling into question workers' rights.
In conclusion, I should like to say that, here, it is really a question of civilization, of basic human values, on which the European Parliament, like the Council of Europe, has a duty to take a stand.
We have a lot of catching up to do here and, as far as I am concerned, we really have to speed things up.
We believe increasingly that we should have a policy of ‘no say, no pay’.
It is a disaster, and Greece needs all possible support from the other Member States and the European Institutions.
Firstly, in relation to an integrated maritime policy, we have already established a working group on such a policy, involving all the Mediterranean coastal states and regional conventions.
(FR) Mr President, this summer there have been various attempts to force our hand with, in addition to this tragic drama, two immediate consequences: firstly, the almost immediate acceptance of the anti-missile defence shield by Poland - even aimed towards Iran this is a problem - and secondly, the commitment of the European Union to finance the reconstruction of Georgia, although we very well know that the foreign affairs budget will not allow this as it is dramatically underfinanced. You said this, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and I support you: we must find other sources of financing, otherwise we may not be able to deal with this situation.
The Commission refers to scientific studies which confirm that the use of BST inflicts unnecessary pain on animals.
Currently, fears about GM foods run high.
The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved.

Besides, dollar area bananas also rely on a heavy reduction in duties.
Mr President, I would like to give an explanation of my negative vote on the report on the European Year of Languages.

We have witnessed many troubles; many political battles have marked recent years in the history of this country, which has become stronger in its democracy.
However, since the nature and extent of the risks to humanity and the environment which are associated with these micro-organisms are not fully known, it is imperative that relevant work is carried out in certain areas which are clearly defined for each class of risk.
Personally, I am very disappointed with the equality sham that the last Council presented after its meeting.
We are very pleased, particularly with the fact that the report calls upon the Member States to do away with inequalities in the area of health, especially those linked to socio-economic factors, gender or age.
Subject: New migratory pressures on Europe
This is partly because the UN conventions offer a shared basis from which we all start.
I hope we can have further debates like this.

I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her proposed reform, which has been accepted in general terms both by the sector and by this Parliament.
I therefore call upon you, Mr President, to remind Mr Berlusconi, not as Head of the Italian Government but as future President-in-Office of the Council and representative of a European institution, that the duty and objective of the European institutions is not to display or demonstrate friendship to peoples but to pursue a single goal, that of peace.
The citizens of the candidate countries are not the only ones to be struck by doubt or uncertainty either. The citizens of the current Member States are too.

The minimum requirements specified in that directive are rather low and the number of exceptions rather high.

They are only interested in hard financial facts.
Secondly, in order to maintain stocks, it asks for a system that must be simple and efficient.
In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on biodiversity and possible effects for people with allergies.
I welcome the fact that Parliament has again had such an in-depth debate on the financing structure and I personally welcome still more the fact that I have been able to discern a great deal of common ground between my own basic position and the positions expressed today in the contributions to the debate.
I would like to thank Claude Desama for his excellent work on this matter.
This means that we have already spent ECU 360 m on these measures alone, to enable the animals to be slaughtered immediately, because ultimately this boosts employment in slaughterhouses.
Mrs Aelvoet requests to speak.
It is quite incredible how the autocratic Mr Lukashenko keeps on believing that he can get away with things in Belarus that would be permitted nowhere else in Europe and allowed nowhere else in the area covered by the OSCE.
For example, we feel that the target of 25% by 2020 presents problems and have tabled amendments on this.
If it was believed that those signatures were not correct, a system of sampling could have been used, for example, in order to verify whether those hundreds of thousands of signatures were really correct. But what is not acceptable is for them to be annulled in this way without in any way bearing in mind more that the one million signatures needed for a recall referendum would have been collected.
It is important that there be a supranational prosecutor able to protect the EU's financial interests.
Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed.
This should be ready for disbursement to the UN by early December 2003. A further EUR 11 million will be committed by the end of 2003 to support the UN's work on local and regional governance, civilian administration, legal and judicial reform, the media and human rights.
Only in this way can we secure freedom to travel as an outstanding characteristic of our society without imposing needless restrictions on it.

In both generations it is undoubtedly quite clear that legislation will play a key role.
And it is true that progress has been made with R+D, but it is also true that progress in the financial contribution is taking place essentially in the public sector, although the greatest differences in terms of investment in this type of activity arise in the private sector.

It has been an excellent example of how Community method at its best can work.
The fees must be based on the traffic-related costs arising during transportation in connection with, for example, noise, effects on the environment, risks of accidents etc. The aim is to create a system of fees that is neutral with regard to competition and does not discriminate against any form of transport.
in writing. - I shall be voting in favour of Helmut Markov's report.
This also applies to the areas of finance, budgets and taxation.
I think that the reply from the Commissioner is good with regard to the general contributions which the EU and the Commission can make, such as providing and gathering information.

I thank you and I thank the Commissioner.
A key aim of the European Council meeting in Tampere should be an agreement to create for the Union a common policy on immigration and asylum.
Madam President, may I put two questions to the Council and the Commission?
The capital, Port-au-Prince, still lies buried under tonnes of rubble and the local people have only shovels and wheelbarrows to remove it with.
Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork's nomination, one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union.
   – Mr President, the accession negotiations under way with Turkey should continue.
5.

European audiovisual practices have resulted in a pluralist media model built around a dual system.
Patent rights and genetic engineering are being wielded by the big corporations in a bid to prevent farmers from reproducing their crops. That was the message emerging from the meeting.

Since we failed to tell our citizens that the rights they have already acquired are not sustainable, they think that they can preserve those rights by opposing both enlargement and reform.
As I have already said, I think it is a matter for regret that in its common position the Council has not seen fit also to give priority to projects which create links with the central and eastern European countries and thus achieve synergies.

Mr President, I want to appeal to the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 116.

Indeed, we would protest against the veritable misappropriation of funds which is proposed: the inappropriate use of resources reserved for agricultural expenditure under Category I of the financial perspective as a source of funding to be used to meet funding requirements in the sphere of foreign policy.
At such a historic time as this, I think that the issue of the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products, or rather the problem of defining the conditions under which products from outside the EU are placed on the single market, is crucial.
Being as realistic as possible, I believe that the EU should do its utmost to ensure greater acceptance of the standards deemed sufficient and seek to bind countries with which it trades into the global effort to respect those rights.

Does this free trade agreement ultimately really only suit the world and the division of economic power between Europe and India that we know today, or will this agreement still be suitable in ten or 15 years' time?

It is about their families and their families' future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the matter of transport in Europe, which we are debating due to the examination of a White Paper with the evocative title 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide' and the report by Mr Collado on this White Paper, is, to me, a perfect example of the gap, not to say the canyon, that exists in Europe in this field, as in many others, between needs and reality, between the stated objectives and the means implemented to achieve them.
